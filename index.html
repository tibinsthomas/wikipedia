						<div class="paragraph">
							Mohanlal Viswanathan (born 21 May 1960), known
							mononymously as Mohanlal, is an Indian actor, film
							producer, playback singer, film distributor, and
							director who predominantly works in Malayalam cinema
							besides also having sporadically appeared in Tamil,
							Hindi, Telugu and Kannada-language films.[3][4][5]
							Mohanlal has a prolific career spanning over four
							decades, during which he has acted in more than 400
							films.[4][6] Mohanlal's contributions to the
							Malayalam cinema have been praised by his
							contemporaries in the Indian film industry.[7][8][9]
							The Government of India honoured him with Padma Shri
							in 2001,[10] and Padma Bhushan in 2019, India's
							fourth and third highest civilian honours,[11] for
							his contributions to Indian cinema. In 2009, he
							became the first actor in India to be awarded the
							honorary rank of Lieutenant colonel in the
							Territorial Army.[12][13] Mohanlal was named as one
							of "the men who changed the face of the Indian
							Cinema" by CNN-News18.[14]
							<p>
								Mohanlal made his acting debut at age 18 in the
								Malayalam film Thiranottam in 1978, but the film
								was delayed in its release for 25 years due to
								censorship issues. His screen debut was in the
								1980 romance film Manjil Virinja Pookkal, in
								which he played the antagonist.[15][16] He
								continued to do villainous roles and rose to
								secondary lead roles in the following years. By
								the mid-1980s, he established himself as a
								bankable leading actor and attained stardom
								after starring in several successful films in
								1986; the crime drama Rajavinte Makan released
								that year heightened his stardom.[15] Mohanlal
								prefers to work in Malayalam films, but he has
								also appeared in some of Hindi, Tamil, Telugu
								and Kannada films. Some of his best known
								non-Malayalam films include the Tamil political
								drama Iruvar (1997), the Hindi crime drama
								Company (2002) and the Telugu film Janatha
								Garage (2016).[17][18]
							</p>
							<p>
								Mohanlal has won five National Film Awards‚Äîtwo
								Best Actor, a Special Jury Mention and a Special
								Jury Award for acting, and an award for Best
								Feature Film (as producer), also nine Kerala
								State Film Awards and Filmfare Awards South and
								numerous other accolades. He received honorary
								doctorates from Sree Sankaracharya University of
								Sanskrit in 2010[19] and the University of
								Calicut in 2018.[20]
							</p>
							<p>
								Mohanlal is also known for his philanthropic
								endeavours. He founded the ViswaSanthi
								Foundation, a non-profit charitable organization
								that was started to create and deliver
								high-impact and focused programs to the
								underprivileged sections of society in the areas
								of Healthcare and Education.[21][22][23]
